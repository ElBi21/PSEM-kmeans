The repo has the following structure:
 - in the **root** of the repo there are the various versions of the $k$-means algorithm, so sequential, with MPI, with OpenMP, with PThread, with CUDA and with MPI + OpenMP;
 - in the `article` folder there is the report of our project;
 - in the `measurements` folder there are the original files that have been used for measuring the performances of our applications. Such files have been zipped in order to reduce the space;
 - in the `results` folder there are the results directly brought in `.json` format;
 - in the `test_files` folder there are some files with the data needed for the algorithm.
